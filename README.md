# 202 Assembler for Arduino
Sometimes a time-critical or sensor-specific piece of code needs to be run in Assembler - either written by you or a 3rd party.

### See the associated YouTube video: https://youtu.be/2ESXfD8X-FQ 

First PCB order free! https://www.pcbway.com 2-sided PCB just $5 for 10 pieces. Assembly for 10-pieces just $30.
PCB Prototyping the easy way - see my video #129 for Hands-On details.

It's so easy to do write a simple Assembler sketch even beginners will find it straightforward, and it's an interesting look at how things "bolt together" behind the scenes. Yes, really.

Don't worry, I'm not expecting anyone to start writing assembler programs but it's so easy you might be tempted just to try it out.
